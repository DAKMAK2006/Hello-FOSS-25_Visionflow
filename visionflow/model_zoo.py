    Creates a pre-trained model from Keras Applications with a new classification head.

    This function supports transfer learning by loading a well-known architecture,
    freezing its layers, and adding a new trainable output layer for your specific task.

    Args:
        model_name (str): The name of the model architecture (e.g., "MobileNetV2", "ResNet50").
        input_shape (tuple): The shape of the input images (height, width, channels).
        num_classes (int): The number of output classes for the new classification head.
        weights (str): Weights to load for the base model. Can be "imagenet" (pre-trained) 
                       or None (random initialization).

    Returns:
        tf.keras.Model: The constructed Keras model ready for training.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the provided model_name is not supported.
